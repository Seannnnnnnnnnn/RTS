\subsection{QAT Algorithm}

So far we have only shown that the \textit{constrained} RTS problem is polylogarithmic in $\Tilde{O}(n+m)$. That is, we can achieve subquadratic run time when we restrict the problem so that $d=1$, all queries are preregistered, and $w(e_i) = 1$ for all stream elements $e_i$. For the remainder of this section, we show how to slightly modify our existing algorithm so that we can solve the more general RTS problem without these assumptions, whilst preserving the complexity of $\Tilde{O}(n+m)$.
