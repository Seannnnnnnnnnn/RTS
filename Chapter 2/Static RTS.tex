% DOCUMENT DEDICATED TO DESCRIBING THE ALGORITHM USED TO SOLVE THE BASIC RTS PROBLEM

\subsection{Constrained RTS}
In the Constrained RTS problem, we restrict the problem conditions as follows: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item  All queries $q_i = (R_{q_i}, \tau_{q_i})$ are defined at the beginning of the data stream, and each $R_{q_i}$ corresponds to a half-open interval of the form $R_{q_i} = [x,y)$
    \item We restrict the dimensionality of the data stream to the $d=1$ case, and also assume that the stream is uniformally weighted such that $w(e_t) = 1$ for all $t$. 
\end{itemize}
We present the details of the \textit{DT Algorithm} \cite{Gan}, which corresponds to a solution of the Constrained RTS problem. First, we introduce pieces of terminology that will be useful throughout the remainder of this thesis. \\
\\
Denote by $Q^*$ the set of pre-registered queries $\{q_1, \dots, q_m\}$, as each query corresponds to an interval $R_q = [x_q,y_q)$\footnote{It is sufficient to assume that each search interval is a half open interval}. The Algorithm works by first constructing a Binary Search Tree $\mathcal{T}$ on the endpoints of the queries' intervals; from here we refer to $\mathcal{T}$ as the \textit{endpoint tree}. We define for each internal node a Jurisdiction Interval as follows: 

\begin{definition}[Jursidiction Interval]
    for each $u\in V(\mathcal{T})$ we define the Jurisdiction Interval $I(u)$ of $u$ to be: 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item if $u$ is a leaf, $I(u) = [u,u^\prime)$ where $u^\prime$ denotes the successor leaf of $u$, with $u^\prime := +\infty$ in the case that such a successor leaf does not exist. 
        \item if $u$ is not a leaf, let $x,y = \text{children}(u)$ and then define $I(u) = I(x) \cup I(y)$ recursively.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
In addition to to each node containing a Jurisdiction Interval, each node is a assigned a counter $c(u)$, each initialised to 0 at the commencement of the algorithm. For an incoming stream element $e$ if $v(e)$ is less than the leftmost endpoint, we safely ignore $e$, otherwise we trace a root-to-leaf path, incrementing the counter of each node $u$ such that $v(e)\in I(u)$. \\
\\
The essence of the DT algorithm is to map these counter increments to instances of Distributed Tracking, so that the amount of message-passing to determine the precise moment that the sum of counters related to a query $q$ reaches $\tau_q$ is minimised. To do this, the algorithm defines a \textit{canonical node set} for each query as follows: 

\begin{definition}[Canonical Node Set]
    For a preregistered query $q$ we define the canonical node set of $q$ to be the smallest collection of nodes $\{u_i, \dots, u_j\}\subseteq V(\mathcal{T})$ such that 
    $$\bigcup_{k=i}^{j}I(u_k) = R_q \hspace{5mm} \text{and} \hspace{5mm} I(u_i)\cap I(u_j) = \emptyset$$
\end{definition}
The algorithm now defines a conceptual Distribution Tracking problem instance for each $q\in Q^*$ with canonical node set $U_q$ as follows. There are $|U_q|$ participants, which correspond to the nodes of $u\in U_q$, with counters $c(u)$. The query itself plays the role of the \textit{coordinator} whose goal is capture maturity the instant that the following condition occurs: 
$$\sum_{u \in U_q}c(u) = \tau_q$$
Recall from our Distributed Tracking algorithm\ref{Algorithm 1}, each $u\in U_q$ also has associated slack value $\lambda = \lfloor \tau/2h \rfloor$. As we increment internal node counters when processing a stream element, we correspond to updating counters within the associated Distributed Tracking instance. \\
\\
The final piece of the algorithm is to describe how to handle inspecting the slack values of each Distributed Tracking instance. 
To do so, the algorithm constructs a a binary min heap $\mathcal{H}(u)$ for each $u\in V(\mathcal{T})$, where the heap contains all queries $q$ such that $u\in U_q$. The min heap is keyed by 
\begin{align}
    \sigma_q(u) := \lambda_q + \Bar{c}_q(u)
\end{align}
The motivation for defining such a heap on each internal node is to reduce the overall messaging cost amongst the Distributed Tracking instances. For example, suppose $q_i$ and $q_j$ both contain $u$ in their canonical node sets, and $\tau_{q_i} < \tau_{q_j}$ which implies that $\lambda_{q_i} < \lambda_{q_j}$. Note that this implies that we can safely ignore inspecting the slack condition of Distributed Tracking instance associated with $q_j$ if we now that the slack condition associated with $q_i$ does not require processing. \\
\\
The final step of the algorithm is to trace a root-to-leaf path for an incoming stream element. Whenever $c(u)$ changes for a node $u$ the algorithm performs the following steps: \begin{enumerate}
    \item Inspect the minimum $\sigma_q(u)$ in $\mathcal{H}(u)$
    \item If $c(u) < \sigma_q(u)$ then we are done.
    \item Otherwise, remove $\sigma_q(u)$ from $\mathcal{H}(u)$ and instruct $u$ to send a signal to $q$ (As in Algorithm \ref{Algorithm 1}). Then repeat from line 1. 
\end{enumerate}
Succinctly, we can described the DT algorithm as follows: 
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{DT }\label{Algorithm 2}
\begin{algorithmic}
\Require a set $Q^*$ of pre-registered RTS queries $q_i = (R_{q_i}, \tau_{q_i})$
\State Construct Seg Tree $\mathcal{T}$ on endpoints of $R_1, \dots, R_m$
\For{ each $u\in V(\mathcal{T})$}
    \State $c(u)\gets 0$
    \State Determine Jurisdiction Interval $I(u)$
\EndFor
\For{ each $q\in Q^*$ }
    \State Determine $U_q$
    \State Create \textit{Distributed Tracking} instance with slack $\lambda_q = \lfloor \tau_q/2h\rfloor$ and auxiliary counter $\Bar{c_q}\gets0$
\EndFor
\For{ each $u\in V(\mathcal{T})$}
    \State Construct $\mathcal{H}(u)$ on all $q\in Q^* : u\in U_q$ with key $\sigma_q(u) := \lambda_q + \Bar{c_q}(u)$
\EndFor
\For{ $t=1,\dots$ process stream element $e_t$ as follows }
    \State Trace root-to-leaf path $P$ based on $v(e_t)$
    \State Set $c(u) \gets c(u)+1$ for each $u\in P$
    \For{ each $u \in P$}
        \State peak-min in $\mathcal{H}(u)$
        \State If $c(u) < \sigma_q(u)$ pass
        \State Otherwise , remove $\sigma_q(u)$ from $\mathcal{H}(u)$ and instruct $u$ to send a signal to $q$ then repeat from peak-min.
    \EndFor
\EndFor
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
We now prove that the DT algorithm described solves the constrained RTS problem in quadratic run time, up to a logarithmic factor.

\begin{lemma}[Finding Canonical Node Sets in Logarithmic Time]
    For a set of $m$ pre-registered RTS queries $q$, one can determine $U_q$ in $O(\log m)$ 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Let $R_q = [x,y)$ and $z_1, z_2$ be the leaves associated with $x, y$ in the endpoint tree. To determine $U_{q}$ let $u$ be the lowest common ancestor of $z_1, z_2$ and then invoke ADD($u$) where:
    \begin{algorithm}
    \begin{algorithmic}
    \Procedure{Add}{$u$}
        \State If $I(u)\subseteq[x,y)$ return $\{u\}$
        \State Else if $I(u)\cap[x,y) = \emptyset$ return $\emptyset$
        \State Else $u_1, u_2 \gets \text{children}(u)$ return ADD($u_1) \cup $ ADD($u_2$)
    \EndProcedure
    \end{algorithmic}
    \end{algorithm}
    The procedure correctly determines the canonical node set, with all added nodes are guaranteed to have disjoint Jurisdiction Intervals by step 4. In the worst case, $u$ is taken to be the root node, which would require a maximum recursive depth of $O(\log m)$. 
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[DT is Computationally Polylogarithmic] For a data stream of $n$ elements and $m$ preregistered RTS queries, the DT algorithm requires runtime $O(n\log m + m\log^2m\log \tau_{max})$ where $\tau_{max}$ is the largest threshold in the query set.
