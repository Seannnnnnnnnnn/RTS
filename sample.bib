abstract = {This paper studies a type of continuous queries called range thresholding on streams (RTS). Imagine the stream as an unbounded sequence of elements each of which is a real value. A query registers an interval, and must be notified as soon as a certain number of incoming elements fall into the interval. The system needs to support multiple queries simultaneously, and aims to minimize the space consumption and computation time. Currently, all the solutions to this problem entail quadratic time O(nm) to process n stream elements and m queries, which severely limits their applicability to only a small number of queries. We propose the first algorithm that breaks the quadratic barrier, by reducing the computation cost dramatically to O(n + m), subject only to a polylogarithmic factor. The algorithm is general enough to guarantee the same on weighted versions of the queries even in d-dimensional space of any constant d. Its vast advantage over the previous methods in practical environments has been confirmed through extensive experimentation.},

abstract = {Consider the following problem: We have k players each receiving a stream of items, and communicating with a central coordinator. Let the multiset of items received by player i up until time t be Ai(t). The coordinator's task is to monitor a given function f computed over the union of the inputs ∪i Ai(t), continuously at all times t. The goal is to minimize the number of bits communicated between the players and the coordinator. Of interest is the approximate version where the coordinator outputs 1 if f ≥ τ and 0 if f≤ (1−ϵ)τ. This defines the (k,f,τ,ϵ) distributed functional monitoring problem. Functional monitoring problems are fundamental in distributed systems, in particular sensor networks, where we must minimize communication; they also connect to the well-studied streaming model and communication complexity. Yet few formal bounds are known for functional monitoring.We give upper and lower bounds for the (k,f,τ,ϵ) problem for some of the basic f's. In particular, we study the frequency moments Fp for p=0,1,2. For F0 and F1, we obtain monitoring algorithms with cost almost the same as algorithms that compute the function for a single instance of time. However, for F2 the monitoring problem seems to be much harder than computing the function for a single time instance. We give a carefully constructed multiround algorithm that uses “sketch summaries” at multiple levels of details and solves the (k,F2,τ,ϵ) problem with communication \~{O}(k2/ϵ + k3/2/ϵ3). Our algorithmic techniques are likely to be useful for other functional monitoring problems as well.},

abstract = {Transformations that serve as tools in the design of new data structures are investigated. Specifically, general methods for converting static structures (in which all elements are known before any searches are performed) to dynamic structures (in which insertions of new elements can be mixed with searches) are studied. Three classes of such transformations are exhibited, each based on a different counting scheme for representing the integers, and a combinatorial model is used to show the optimality of many of the transformations. Issues such as online data structures and deletion of elements are also examined. To demonstrate the applicability of these tools, several new data structures that have been developed by applying the transformations are studied.}
