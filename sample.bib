abstract = {Transformations that serve as tools in the design of new data structures are investigated. Specifically, general methods for converting static structures (in which all elements are known before any searches are performed) to dynamic structures (in which insertions of new elements can be mixed with searches) are studied. Three classes of such transformations are exhibited, each based on a different counting scheme for representing the integers, and a combinatorial model is used to show the optimality of many of the transformations. Issues such as online data structures and deletion of elements are also examined. To demonstrate the applicability of these tools, several new data structures that have been developed by applying the transformations are studied.}

abstract = {Consider the following problem: We have k players each receiving a stream of items, and communicating with a central coordinator. Let the multiset of items received by player i up until time t be Ai(t). The coordinator's task is to monitor a given function f computed over the union of the inputs ∪i Ai(t), continuously at all times t. The goal is to minimize the number of bits communicated between the players and the coordinator. Of interest is the approximate version where the coordinator outputs 1 if f ≥ τ and 0 if f≤ (1−ϵ)τ. This defines the (k,f,τ,ϵ) distributed functional monitoring problem. Functional monitoring problems are fundamental in distributed systems, in particular sensor networks, where we must minimize communication; they also connect to the well-studied streaming model and communication complexity. Yet few formal bounds are known for functional monitoring.We give upper and lower bounds for the (k,f,τ,ϵ) problem for some of the basic f's. In particular, we study the frequency moments Fp for p=0,1,2. For F0 and F1, we obtain monitoring algorithms with cost almost the same as algorithms that compute the function for a single instance of time. However, for F2 the monitoring problem seems to be much harder than computing the function for a single time instance. We give a carefully constructed multiround algorithm that uses “sketch summaries” at multiple levels of details and solves the (k,F2,τ,ϵ) problem with communication \~{O}(k2/ϵ + k3/2/ϵ3). Our algorithmic techniques are likely to be useful for other functional monitoring problems as well.},

abstract = {This well-accepted introduction to computational geometry is a textbook for high-level undergraduate and low-level graduate courses. The focus is on algorithms and hence the book is well suited for students in computer science and engineering. Motivation is provided from the application areas: all solutions and techniques from computational geometry are related to particular applications in robotics, graphics, CAD/CAM, and geographic information systems. For students this motivation will be especially welcome. Modern insights in computational geometry are used to provide solutions that are both efficient and easy to understand and implement. All the basic techniques and topics from computational geometry, as well as several more advanced topics, are covered. The book is largely self-contained and can be used for self-study by anyone with a basic background in algorithms. In this third edition, besides revisions to the second edition, new sections discussing Voronoi diagrams of line segments, farthest-point Voronoi diagrams, and realistic input models have been added.}

abstract = {In this paper, we study the (approximate) Range Thresholding (RT) problem over streams. Each stream element is a d-dimensional point and with a positive integer weight. An RT query q specifies a d-dimensional axis-parallel rectangular range R(q) and a positive integer threshold τ(q). Once the query q is registered in the system, define s(q) as the total weight of the elements that satisfy: (i) they arrive after q's registration, and (ii) they fall in the range R(q). Given a real number 0 &lt; ε &lt; 1, the task of the system is to capture an arbitrary moment during the period between the first moment when s(q) ≥ (1 - ε)⋅ τ(q) and the first moment when s(q) ≥ τ(q). The challenge is to support a large number of RT queries simultaneously while achieving sub-quadratic overall running time and near-linear space consumption all the time.We propose a new algorithm called FastRTS, which can reduce the exponent in the poly-logarithmic factor of the state-of-the-art QGT algorithm from d+1 to d, yet slightly increasing the \l{}og term itself. Besides, we propose two extremely effective optimization techniques which significantly improve the practical performance of FastRTS. Experimental results show that FastRTS outperforms the competitors by up to three orders of magnitude in both running time and peak memory usage.},

This study shows that HFTs cancel a large number of limit orders within 50 ms in order to create arbitrage opportunities in the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX). We find that HFTs generate substantial profits after transaction costs and are capable of extending their strong profitability generating record in the future. Our empirical results indicate that institutional investors lacking speed are more likely to experience higher execution costs. We propose the introduction of batch auctions, one per 50 ms of trading, to impose a queuing risk for HFTs leading to positive market quality effects.},
